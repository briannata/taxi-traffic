# taxi-traffic
An algorithm to recognize, display, and predict highest areas of taxi demand in DC
* taxi.ipynb: clusters the 2019 data using the k-means algorithm for each month and prints out text files with the cluster dictionaries
* taxi_predictions.ipynb: takes the cluster dictionaries from taxi.ipynb and uses that data to predict the highest areas of taxi demand in future months
<<<<<<< HEAD
* GMap.ipynb: takes the data from taxi.ipynb and taxi_predictions.ipynb and plots them on the DC map
